Go Inside that Directory with command " cd /Path where Directory Created/Directory Name "Press Enter"


Now, Create Dockerfile | open vim editor by the help of command 


                " vi Dockerfile "

                " FROM  alpine:latest
                  CMD  ["echo", "Hello Rahul"]  "


                
after write file save it, press shift and colon key (:) from keyboard and type "wq", press enter key


Now, build Docker Image from Dockerfile with following command


               "  docker build -t (Image Name whatever you want put on here)  . (this dot means from current directory) " and press enter
               Example:  docker build -t project-a (Image name)  .


               
After build image create container with help of command 


              "  docker run --name web (container name)  project-a (Image name)" and press enter 

              
While creating container, CMD command print a output on terminal
